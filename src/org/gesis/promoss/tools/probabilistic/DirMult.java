 * This class has all typical variables needed in probabilistic
 * models involving (mixtures of) hierarchical multinomial distributions with Dirichlet priors.
 * This class also can be used for hierarchical multi-Dirichlet processes.
 * 
 * The variables are based on the Chinese restaurant metaphor (customers and tables).
 * 
 * Additionally, I give standard functions for parameter estimation.
